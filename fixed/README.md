# Fixed files

Three production blockers. Each file below is complete — open it, select all,
and paste over the matching file on your site. Nothing else was touched.

The `.zip` files in the repository root are still the original upload. These are
the patched versions of three files taken from inside them.

## What to copy where

| Copy this file | Over this one on your site |
| --- | --- |
| `fixed/kaamase/inc/enqueue.php` | `wp-content/themes/kaamase/inc/enqueue.php` |
| `fixed/kaamase-core/includes/queries.php` | `wp-content/plugins/kaamase-core/includes/queries.php` |
| `fixed/kaamase/functions.php` | `wp-content/themes/kaamase/functions.php` |

Do them one at a time and check the site after each.

## 1. `kaamase/inc/enqueue.php` — front end forms reach their handler again

`kaamase_block_admin_access()` runs on `admin_init`. WordPress fires `admin_init`
from `admin-post.php` **before** it fires `admin_post_{action}`, so for anyone
without `edit_posts` the redirect ran first and the handler never ran. The
submission was thrown away with no error and the person landed on the dashboard.

This is the fault noted in `checkout.php` and `account.php` as something on the
host sitting in front of `admin-post.php`. It was the theme.

Fixed by treating `admin-post.php` and `admin-ajax.php` as form handlers rather
than as dashboard screens. wp-admin itself is still blocked for non-editing users
exactly as before.

**Restores:** job alerts, verification requests, hiring requests, adding the
working side, and posting on behalf of somebody else.

**Test as a worker or employer, not as an admin** — admins were never affected.

## 2. `kaamase-core/includes/queries.php` — new workers appear in the sorts

Setting `meta_key` and ordering by `meta_value_num` makes `WP_Query` INNER JOIN
`postmeta`. A profile with no row for that key was not sorted last, it was
removed from the results.

Registration writes only a phone number and a district. The `'default' => 0` in
the field schema is a read-time fallback and never writes a row. So every worker
who had registered but not yet completed their profile was missing from **Best
rated**, **Most experienced** and **Lowest day rate** — and on a site where
nobody had been rated yet, Best rated was empty.

Replaced with a LEFT JOIN built in `posts_join` and `posts_orderby`, the same
pattern the availability rotation already uses in this file. Everybody is
returned, real values sort first, blanks sort last in both directions.

A stored zero counts as no answer for Lowest day rate, so a blank rate no longer
ranks as the cheapest worker on the platform.

The job sorts (Highest pay, Urgent) had the same fault and are fixed too.

**Test:** register a worker, fill in nothing, then open Best rated. They should
appear at the bottom instead of vanishing.

## 3. `kaamase/functions.php` — returning visitors get the current stylesheet

`KAAMASE_VERSION` was a hand-written constant that had drifted to `1.2.0` while
`style.css` said `1.5.0`. It is what `KAAMASE_ASSET_VERSION` falls back to in
production, so every release after 1.2.0 went out behind an unchanged `?ver=`
string and returning visitors kept the CSS and JS they already had.

The version is now read from the `Version:` header in `style.css`, which is what
WordPress already treats as the version of record.

**From now on, bumping `style.css` is the only step.** Do not add the number
anywhere else.

**Test:** view source on the front end. The stylesheet should be
`style.css?ver=1.5.0`.

## Not changed, and why

- **`kaamase-pay`** — payment start, confirmation and cancellation were *not*
  broken. Each already has a `template_redirect` fallback
  (`kaamase_pay_catch_start`, `_catch_verify`, `_catch_cancel`) that was catching
  these on the front end. Fix 1 repairs the `admin-post.php` route they also
  register, so both paths now work. Razorpay signature verification was not
  touched.
- **The privacy layer** — untouched. No change to `kaamase_field`,
  `kaamase_can_see_private`, or private-field handling.
- **`KAAMASE_CORE_VERSION`** (says `1.3.0`, header says `1.3.1`) — defined but
  never used anywhere, so it affects nothing. Worth tidying later.
- **`kaamase/readme.txt`** — changelog still stops at 1.1.0. Cosmetic.
